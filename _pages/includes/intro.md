I work at [NUS HPC-AI-Lab](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/) <img src='./images/nus_logo_full-horizontal.jpg' style='width: 6em;'> as a master student now in Singapore, doing large language models. 

I am also working as NVIDIA Partner in CN, Completed the construction of a large-scale HPC-AI computing center in China. If you are seeking any form of **computing resource cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [chen.yunan_01@u.nus.edu](mailto:chen.yunan_01@u.nus.edu) or contact with me in Wechat(微信) account: **Nirvana00000010**.

I graduated from School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Guangdong Ocean University with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Computer Science and Technology advised by [Xie Shiyi (谢仕义)](https://www.scholat.com/shiyixie), and as **Cpp Software Development Innovation and Entrepreneupship Team** owner (2018-2021), led over 35 teammates won 30+ national,provincial level awards. In NUS, I'm currently a master student Fellow at National University of Singapore with Prof. [Yang You (尤洋)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/). 

My research interest particularly interested in: 1. Large parameter models’ capabilities, which involves reasoning, in context learning, and long-range understanding. 2. Compute-optimal learning, which involves sample efficient learning, model compression, and knowledge distillation. 3. Training/Inference Effciency in HPC-AI Center including temperature/Flops Utilization/Communication efficiency.
